Based on the incident analysis, I need you to create a detailed troubleshooting plan. Each step should be clearly defined and executable by another agent.

For each step, provide:
1. A step number
2. A clear, detailed description of what needs to be done
3. The expected outcome or information to be gathered
4. Any specific commands, tools, or techniques that should be used

Remember that these steps will be delegated to other agents, so they need to be self-contained and actionable.

Incident summary:
{{ incident_summary }}
