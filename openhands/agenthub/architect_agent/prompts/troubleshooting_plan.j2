Based on the incident analysis, I need you to create a detailed troubleshooting plan. Each step should be clearly defined and executable by another agent.

You are creating a structured troubleshooting plan that will be executed using the delegate_step tool.

For each step in your plan, provide:
1. A unique step ID (e.g., "step-1", "step-2")
2. A clear, detailed description of what needs to be done
3. The expected outcome or information to be gathered
4. Specific commands, tools, or techniques that should be used
5. The appropriate agent to handle this step

Remember that each step will be delegated to specific agents using the delegate_step tool, so steps need to be self-contained and actionable with clear success criteria.
