I need your help analyzing and resolving an incident. Please:

1. Analyze the incident description to understand the nature and potential causes of the issue
2. Create a structured troubleshooting plan with specific, actionable tasks
3. Delegate each task to appropriate specialized agents using the delegate_task_to_agent tool
4. Use the think tool to reason through complex aspects of the problem when needed
5. Process the results from delegated tasks and determine the root cause of the incident
6. When you believe you've found the solution, provide a final root cause analysis with your findings and explicitly state that the task is complete

As you work, please:
- Create a clear troubleshooting plan with 3-5 prioritized steps
- Match each task with the most appropriate agent based on their capabilities
- Provide detailed instructions when delegating tasks
- Keep me informed of your analysis and findings
